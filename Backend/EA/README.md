- 'extract-blackbox-data.js' is used to extract the components for each detected EA Blackbox, given as input an XML file which can contain multiple Blackboxes.
- 'matchLeftsAndRights()' and 'excludeNonExpansibleItems()' are used to ensure that we apply regex on the correct portion of the input data. 'excludeNonExpansibleItems()' ensures that for each <UML:Package> we have closing </UML:Package>, while 'matchLeftsAndRights()' ensure that for each <UML:Package>, we pair it with the correct closing </UML:Package>. Without 'matchLeftsAndRights()', regex would pair <UML:Package> with the first </UML:Package> it finds, which is not necessarily the correct closing one.
